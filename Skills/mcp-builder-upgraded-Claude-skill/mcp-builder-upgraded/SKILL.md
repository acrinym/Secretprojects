# MCP Server Development Guide

## Overview

Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.

> **⚡ Context7 First:** This skill uses [Context7](https://context7.com) — an MCP server that injects live, version-accurate library documentation directly into context. Whenever you need SDK docs, API references, or framework guides during development, fetch them via Context7 instead of relying on potentially stale training data. See [Phase 1.3](#13-study-framework-documentation) for setup.

# Process

## 🚀 High-Level Workflow

Creating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:

### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning

#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design

**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**
Balance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.

**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**
Clear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.

**Context Management:**
Agents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.

**Actionable Error Messages:**
Error messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.

#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation

**Navigate the MCP specification:**

Start with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`

Then fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).

Key pages to review:
- Specification overview and architecture
- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)
- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions

#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation

**Recommended stack:**
- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.

### 🌐 Context7: Live Documentation Fetching

**Always use Context7 to retrieve up-to-date SDK and library docs before writing any code.** Context7 is an MCP server that injects current, version-specific documentation into your context window — eliminating hallucinated APIs and stale examples.

**Setup (choose one):**

```json
// Remote HTTP (recommended — no install required)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}

// Local stdio (Node.js >= 18 required)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"],
      "env": { "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

Get a free API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard) for higher rate limits (works without a key too).

**Context7 MCP Tools:**

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `resolve-library-id` | First call — converts a library name (e.g., `"modelcontextprotocol typescript sdk"`) into a `/org/project` ID |
| `query-docs` | Second call — fetches focused, version-accurate docs for a library ID given your current question |

**Workflow during development:**
1. Identify the library/SDK you need (e.g., MCP TypeScript SDK, Zod, FastMCP)
2. Call `resolve-library-id` with the library name → get `/org/project` ID
3. Call `query-docs` with the ID + your specific question → get live docs
4. Use the returned examples directly in your implementation

**Quick prompts for this skill:**
```
# Get MCP TypeScript SDK docs
use library /modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk — how do I register a tool with outputSchema?

# Get MCP Python SDK docs  
use library /modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk — how do I use FastMCP with Pydantic models?

# Get Zod docs
use library /colinhacks/zod — how do I define optional fields with defaults?

# General (let Context7 resolve)
How do I implement streamable HTTP transport? use context7
```

> ⚠️ **Do NOT call `query-docs` more than 3 times per question.** If you can't find what you need, use the best result you have and proceed.

**Load framework documentation:**

- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines

**For TypeScript (recommended):**
- **TypeScript SDK via Context7**: `resolve-library-id("modelcontextprotocol typescript-sdk")` → then `query-docs` with your question. *(Fallback: WebFetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`)*
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples

**For Python:**
- **Python SDK via Context7**: `resolve-library-id("modelcontextprotocol python-sdk")` → then `query-docs` with your question. *(Fallback: WebFetch `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`)*
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples

**For any third-party library** used in your MCP server (e.g., axios, httpx, pydantic, zod, jose):
- Always resolve and query via Context7 before writing integration code
- Include the library version in your prompt if known (e.g., `"zod v3"`) for version-accurate results

#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation

**Understand the API:**
Review the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.

**Tool Selection:**
Prioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.

---

### Phase 2: Implementation

#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure

See language-specific guides for project setup:
- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json
- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies

> **Context7 tip:** After adding dependencies to `package.json` / `requirements.txt`, use Context7 to fetch their current APIs before using them. For example: `How do I use jose for JWT verification? use library /panva/jose`

#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure

Create shared utilities:
- API client with authentication
- Error handling helpers
- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)
- Pagination support

> **Context7 tip:** If using an HTTP client library (axios, got, httpx, etc.), resolve and query it via Context7 before writing the client wrapper.

#### 2.3 Implement Tools

For each tool:

**Input Schema:**
- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)
- Include constraints and clear descriptions
- Add examples in field descriptions

**Output Schema:**
- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data
- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)
- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs

**Tool Description:**
- Concise summary of functionality
- Parameter descriptions
- Return type schema

**Implementation:**
- Async/await for I/O operations
- Proper error handling with actionable messages
- Support pagination where applicable
- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs

**Annotations:**
- `readOnlyHint`: true/false
- `destructiveHint`: true/false
- `idempotentHint`: true/false
- `openWorldHint`: true/false

---

### Phase 3: Review and Test

#### 3.1 Code Quality

Review for:
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)
- Consistent error handling
- Full type coverage
- Clear tool descriptions

#### 3.2 Build and Test

**TypeScript:**
- Run `npm run build` to verify compilation
- Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector`

**Python:**
- Verify syntax: `python -m py_compile your_server.py`
- Test with MCP Inspector

See language-specific guides for detailed testing approaches and quality checklists.

---

### Phase 4: Create Evaluations

After implementing your MCP server, create comprehensive evaluations to test its effectiveness.

**Load [✅ Evaluation Guide](./reference/evaluation.md) for complete evaluation guidelines.**

#### 4.1 Understand Evaluation Purpose

Use evaluations to test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions.

#### 4.2 Create 10 Evaluation Questions

To create effective evaluations, follow the process outlined in the evaluation guide:

1. **Tool Inspection**: List available tools and understand their capabilities
2. **Content Exploration**: Use READ-ONLY operations to explore available data
3. **Question Generation**: Create 10 complex, realistic questions
4. **Answer Verification**: Solve each question yourself to verify answers

#### 4.3 Evaluation Requirements

Ensure each question is:
- **Independent**: Not dependent on other questions
- **Read-only**: Only non-destructive operations required
- **Complex**: Requiring multiple tool calls and deep exploration
- **Realistic**: Based on real use cases humans would care about
- **Verifiable**: Single, clear answer that can be verified by string comparison
- **Stable**: Answer won't change over time

#### 4.4 Output Format

Create an XML file with this structure:

```xml
<evaluation>
  <qa_pair>
    <question>Find discussions about AI model launches with animal codenames. One model needed a specific safety designation that uses the format ASL-X. What number X was being determined for the model named after a spotted wild cat?</question>
    <answer>3</answer>
  </qa_pair>
<!-- More qa_pairs... -->
</evaluation>
```
